A loop in Python allows you to execute a block of code repeatedly. There are two types of loops in Python: the for loop and the while loop.

Here's an example of a for loop:

Copy code
for i in range(10):
    print(i)
This for loop will iterate over the numbers 0 through 9 and print each number to the console. The range() function is used to create a sequence of numbers that the loop will iterate over.

Here's an example of a while loop:

Copy code
i = 0
while i < 10:
    print(i)
    i += 1
This while loop will also print the numbers 0 through 9 to the console. The loop will continue to execute as long as the value of i is less than 10. The value of i is incremented by 1 each time the loop runs with the i += 1 statement.
