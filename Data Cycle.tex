There are various types of Linux Distros that you can try:

\begin{itemize}

\item [\ding{71}] We say that data follows a cycle because once used, it can generate new data, sometimes more precise.

\item [\ding{71}] En 1997 une intelligence artificielle a battu le meilleur joueur d'échecs. 
Elle s'est notamment servie des données récoltées de précédentes parties pour faire ses choix.


Pour adapter ses messages à ses différents clients, une marque peut s’appuyer sur les données qu’elle récolte au quotidien pour: Créer des segments de client, Catégoriser des clients aux comportements similaires, Adresser des messages personnalisés


Il existe d'autres types d'analyse : l'analyse prescriptive, l'analyse descriptive et l'analyse de diagnostic.

\section{Data portability} = protect users from having their data stored in "silos" or "walled gardens" that are incompatible with one another, i.e. closed platforms.

\section{GDPR}
Adopted by the European Commission in April 2016, the GDPR enters into force on 25 May 2018 for all member states of the European Union. It is intended to unify the European legal framework for data protection.

Data circulating internally is is exposed to risks of interception. For this reason, emails sent between employees should be encrypted encrypted.
Encryption of communications is not a new phenomenon. The Enigma machine, developed in 1918 and used during the Second World War, was an early example of a system for automatically encrypting and decrypting strategic information.


Not all machines or all users have the same security requirements. A printer connected to the internal network is much less exposed than a computer connected to the internet. In order to protect them, machines and users should be grouped into systems sharing the same security requirements.

It is essential to protect data circulating internally from external threats, including emails. As they pass onto the company’s servers, they are exposed to interception attempts. For their protection, emails must be end-to-end encrypted. In this way, only the sender and the recipient can read them.

Setting up and managing a minimum security level are the responsibility of the ISD. Consequently, small structures which do not have the ability to employ an ISD and which have not defined a minimum security base are highly exposed to the risk of computer attacks.

Algorithms will first "test" words contained in dictionaries and not including any so-called complex characters, such as accents and numbers, and special characters such as the following punctuation symbols: , : - _ / ! ? .

\section{Cognitive security}

Cognitive security tools will read and learn from tens of thousands of available sources of information. This extensive knowledge will uncover new insights and patterns, and it will allow to anticipate, isolate and minimize attacks as they happen.
Because cybercrime is nowadays organized and heavily funded, many criminals are turning to advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence. We might be moving towards a future where AI security tools respond to AI-powered threats.
